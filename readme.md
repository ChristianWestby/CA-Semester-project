1. Summary

Attempts have been made to reach the relevant target group between 7 and 14 years of age.
My thinking is that I wanted to create a tight and stylish page and design that could appeal to everyone, but especially to the relevant target group.
I have played on colors and images that will attract the attention of the target groups.
I also deliberately don't have an ordinary nav-bar, but a continuous burger-menu tornado logo. I think this appeals to something new and full of design and attractive to the target group.
I have only used designs I have come up with myself and in no way copied code from the web or AI. It is felt that the design was very different in the coding than what I drew in Figma. I have learned a great deal from this assignment and working alone. The task has been found challenging and I deliver within the deadline, but am not finished. The coding has taken longer than planned and it has been difficult to follow the Trello planning.
Will follow up with improvements over the next few days and re submitting as agreed.

2. Body

2.1. Introduction
 This is the report belonging to Semester project 1 in Front-End development 1st year 2023 Campus Oslo.
The report briefly describes what has been done and what is planned.

2.2. Main section of report
 It was given in the exam assignment, semester project, to create a planning overview in a method program. After that, it was given in the exam task to design 4-6 pages in a design program. The theme for the design was a Science web design with a target group of 7 to 14 year kids. Furthermore, it was given in the exam to produce this in a code terminal with HTML and CSS.
One week was given to plan the design and method. Furthermore, 4 weeks were given to design and code and write the associated
 report.


2.3. Conclusion

This has been a tough and very educational task.
I have learned a lot along the way. It was the first time we had to plan a project and the first time we had to plan in a method program. This proved difficult to follow. The design took longer than planned. It was actually difficult to remember everything we had learned at the beginning of the semester in relation to Figma. But eventually it got resolved and the design started to flow quite smoothly. 

I faced the same challenge when I was about to start coding. But then I started to fall behind on time and start to stress.
I have worked from morning to night and sometimes I have worked through the night. Feels that a lot lies in the planning and the failure of this.
I also spend some time coding and solving problems. But I work steadily and dedicatedly.
I have learned a lot from these mistakes and from the use of time. In the planning phase, I should have taken greater account of longer use of time with the coding and any problems.
The positive thing is that I feel that the design in Figma turned out well and as I imagined. I tested the design on my 6 year old son and he was immediately interested and wanted to print all the cool pictures and wondered if we could go to this museum.
Furthermore, I feel that the design comes across better in mobile and tablet than in the desktop coding, and this is something I reflect a lot on and will then take into account in the next project.
The design has appealing colours, a clean design that describes professionalism, and appealing images for the target group.

My conclusion is that I missed the use of time for the design implementation and that this propagated further into the project and the coding. The coding itself has gone well, but I feel that the design fell through a bit when I coded it. I think this comes down to the time aspect I'm left with and that I stressed through the last rest of the coding. 
I wish I had managed my time better and could have enjoyed coding more.
But all in all, I'm happy with myself.
